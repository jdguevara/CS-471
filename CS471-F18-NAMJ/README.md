## Team Name: NAMJ

## Sponsor Name: Git Time Lapse View

## Project Description:

Git Time-Lapse View is a cross-platform viewer that downloads all revisions of a file and lets you scroll through them by dragging a slider. As you scroll, you are shown a visual diff of the current revision and the previous revision. Thus you can see how a file evolved, and you can easily find the revision at which lines appeared, disappeared, or changed.

Time-Lapse View is a powerful visual alternative to the Git "blame" command. It is inspired by the excellent Time-Lapse View in the Perforce version-control system.
